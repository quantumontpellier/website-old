I am a PhD student working on quantum computing at [LIRMM](https://www.lirmm.fr/) and [CERFACS](https://cerfacs.fr/). My research interests includes quantum algorithms, tools related to quantum computing (profilers, compilers, ...), algorithmic complexity and how quantum computing may speed-up scientific computing in general.
