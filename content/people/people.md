# Hugo will only generate a user’s profile if the user is associated with a piece of content
# by having their username appear in the authors field of a page’s front matter. Therefore,
# if a user does not appear in the widget, edit the user’s profile to add an authors field
# containing their username (folder name) to force Hugo to generate their profile even though
# it’s not directly associated with any content.
